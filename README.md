# Aurora

This a project containg all the codes and data required for Aurora workshop. 

Here i have made an open cv project where i am using a camera and detecting my face. 
Then i am converting all the surroundings of my face to blur and black and white.
As for the resources i have used , i just learned opencv concept and codes from the youtube channel " Murtaza's Workshop" and nothing else.
